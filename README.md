# Hey, I'm Meetrajsinh 👋

## 🚀 ML Engineer building the future with AI

Currently crafting **multi-agent AI systems** and **computer vision models** at **University of Stuttgart** and **Hitachi Rail**. I turn complex AI research into production-ready solutions that actually work.

**What I'm obsessed with:**
- 🤖 **LLMs & AI Agents** - Building systems that think and collaborate
- 👁️ **Computer Vision** - Teaching machines to see and understand
- 🚆 **AI in Transportation** - Making autonomous systems safer and smarter

## 🔥 Currently Building

- **Multi Agents AI Systems** for workflow Automation and Response Generation from past Learning
- **Diffusion Models** for autonomous driving applications
- **Advanced RAG Systems** that actually understand context and enhance response in German language in particular.

## 🛠️ My Stack

**AI/ML:** PyTorch • LangChain • CrewAI • Langgraph • Agno  • Computer Vision • LLM Fine-tuning  
**Engineering:** Python • FastAPI • Docker • AWS • Azure • Kubernetes   
**Specialties:** Multi-Agent Systems • MLOps • Production AI
